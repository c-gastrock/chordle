# Chordle

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.4.

## TODO:

- Will use https://www.hooktheory.com/api/trends/docs for chord generation (provides probability of different chords to follow a given chord).

- A good idea to look into the Web Audio API https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API to see if its worth using for chord playback.
